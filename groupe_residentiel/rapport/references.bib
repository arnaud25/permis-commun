  abstract={Worldwide variations in the population structure are taking place over the next century, and this is expected to have impacts on the whole economic systems, and particularly on the housing market (i.e. price of homes, ownership structure, and supply and demand of residential properties). In this paper, we empirically investigate how the French real estate is affected by both economic and demographic factors. Starting from the theoretical benchmark model of TakÂˆts (2012), we fist investigate the relationship between collective and individual housing prices dynamics and GDP, total population and old age dependency ratio. Results from fixed effect regressions on 94 French departments on the period 2000-2013 show that real estate prices are significantly and positively affected by the total population number and the total GDP, while they are significantly and negatively affected by the old age dependency ratio (ratio of population aged 60+ to the working population). This study, to our knowledge, is conducted for the first time across departments in France. Furthermore, obtained results and the particular case of France have motivated further research by enriching the baseline model with various financial, real estate, economic and demographic explanatory variables and analyzing our panel in a more segmented way. In all cases, economic impact on real estate market is significant and around the unit_ i.e. 1\% increase in GDP leads a 1\% increase in housing prices_ while demographic factors seem to have a greater impact on housing market prices.},

 abstract = {There are obvious reasons why residential construction should depend on the population's age structure. We estimate this relation on Swedish time series data and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development panel data. Large groups of young adults are associated with higher rates of residential construction, but there is also a significant negative effect from those above 75. Age effects on residential investment are robust and forecast well out-of-sample in contrast to the corresponding house price results. This may explain why the debate around house prices and demography has been rather inconclusive. Rapidly aging populations in the industrialized world makes the future look bleak for the construction industry.},

abstract = "Microeconomic theory suggests that consumers do not consume and suppliers do not supply housing units. Housing units are an artifact of the way in which individuals cluster in residential real estate. The most fundamental measure of willingness to pay on the part of consumers and cost of production experienced by producers is interior space. Empirical literature on housing supply in cities has been based on counts of housing units primarily because counts of units are readily available, across time and space. This paper shows how to produce estimates of aggregate square feet of housing. A theory section then demonstrates that measuring supply elasticities using counts of units are biased downward compared to results using interior space. Finally empirical tests confirm the theoretical evidence that housing supply estimates based on counts of units are too small."

abstract = {ABSTRACTResearch into the links between construction output and broader economic development has provided valuable references for inducing theoretical, empirical and policy implications. However, the impact of the construction and property markets on the construction output have not been fully addressed yet. This research argues an inter-market equilibrium between residential construction output and the related markets in terms of construction and property prices. Implementing the panel error correction model, longitudinal data of Australian capital cities is used to identify the inter-market equilibrium and associated dynamic patterns across the observed cities. Subsequently, by comparing the simulated and actual residential construction outputs, the estimated findings are evaluated. The inter-market equilibriums in the Australian capital cities appeared in geographic-spatial clusters while the economy-scale-spatial clusters were observed in dynamic patterns. }

abstract = "Most housing models, and most policy analysis, hinge on explicit or implicit estimates of the price elasticity of supply of housing: does the market respond to demand side shocks with more supply or higher prices? Building on a model originally developed by Steve Mayo, we estimate the price elasticity of supply of housing from new construction separately for the United States and for the United Kingdom. We examine the supply elasticity over a very long time frame—from the previous century. There is strong evidence of a “regime shift” in 1914–1947; over the entire period, prices rise in both countries, but not in a continuous manner. Post World War II, the United States is essentially flat, albeit with very large cycles. In the UK, relative housing prices generally rise postwar. According to our flow model, in the prewar United States our implied price elasticity is between 4 and 10, postwar it is between 6 and 13. In the prewar UK our implied price elasticity is between 1 and 4, postwar it is between 0 and 1. Stock adjustment models yield different price elasticities—surprisingly so, in our judgment. They range from 1 to 6 for the United States, and from 0 to 1 for the UK. We believe the stock adjustment models are particularly fruitful areas for additional work."

abstract = {For stationary transformations of variables, there exists a maximum horizon beyond which forecasts can provide no more information about the variable than is present in the unconditional mean. Meteorological forecasts, typically excepting only experimental or exploratory situations, are not reported beyond this horizon; by contrast, little generally accepted information about such maximum horizons is available for economic variables. The authors estimate such content horizons for a variety of economic variables, and compare these with the maximum horizons that they observe reported in a large sample of empirical economic forecasting studies. The authors find that many published studies provide forecasts exceeding, often by substantial margins, their estimates of the content horizon for the particular variable and frequency. The authors suggest some simple reporting practices for forecasts that could potentially bring greater transparency to the process of making and interpreting economic forecasts.},
